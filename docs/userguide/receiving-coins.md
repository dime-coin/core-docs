## Receiving Coins with Dimecoin-QT

So you have installed the desktop wallet and it has finished syncing. However, you have not been able to figure out how to generate an address to be able to send coins to your wallet. This guide will show how to generate a `receiving address` in your wallet so you can receive coins.

```{note}
It is recommended, although not required, to generate a new address each time you send coins to the wallet. For a detailed explanation as to why, see the section on [avoiding key reuse](../guide/transactions-avoiding-key-reuse.md#avoiding-key-reuse)
```

### Step 1: Start Dimecoin Core

Once your client has finished loading, open your wallet and navigate to top menu bar and click `File`.

### Step 2: Navigate File Menu

From the File menu, select `Receiving Addresses`.
