### Introduction

The Core Guide section is designed to serve as a comprehensive resource for users and developers interested in Dimecoin Core and related applications. This section contains detailed tutorials, practical how-to guides, and detailed explanations. These resources aim to facilitate a deeper understanding of the mechanisms behind Dimecoin Core, guiding you through setup, operation, and optimization. Whether you are a beginner looking to get started with Dimecoin or an experienced developer seeking advanced techniques, this section provides the knowledge and tools necessary to navigate the ecosystem of Dimecoin Core.

It is important to remember that this documentation does not serve as a specification; rather, it serves as a guide to understanding the fundamental operations and mechanisms of Dimecoin, aiming to educate and facilitate development within the Dimecoin ecosystem.

Any questions about Dimecoin development are best asked in one of the [Dimecoin's communites](https://www.dimecoinnetwork.com/socials/). There you will be able to find active contributors to the project. Find an error or have suggestions related to this documentation?

### Specification Disclaimer

This documentation serves to educate users and developers about how Dimecoin works, but it is not intended as a specification. Dimecoin’s security hinges on consensus; deviations, regardless of their origin—be it a program bug, an error in this documentation, or anomalies in network software—can compromise or entirely undermine that security. The accurate measure of consensus behavior is the real-time operation of the network maintaining consensus. Given the network’s diverse inputs and environments, fully capturing every aspect of their behavior in any documentation is impossible.

In addition, we also warn you that this documentation is continually evolving and is often not heavily reviewed, so it likely contains numerous errors.
