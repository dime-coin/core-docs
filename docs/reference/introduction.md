  :title: Dimecoin Core Introduction
  :description: The Developer Reference provides technical details for building Dimecoin-based applications. 
```

### Introduction

The developer reference section provides technical details and API information to help you start building Dimecoin-based applications. It is important to remember that this documentation does not serve as a specification; rather, it serves as a guide to understanding the fundamental operations and mechanisms of Dimecoin, aiming to educate and facilitate development within the Dimecoin ecosystem.

To make the best use of this documentation, you may want to install the most recent version of Dimecoin Core. You can do so by running the [source](https://www.github.com/dime-coin/dimecoin) code or by using a [pre-compiled binary](https://github.com/dime-coin/dimecoin/releases/latest).

Any questions about Dimecoin development are best asked in one of the [Dimecoin's communites](https://www.dimecoinnetwork.com/socials/). There you will be able to find active contributors to the project. Find an error or have suggestions related to this documentation? You can submit change requests via the "Edit this Page" button at the top-right of each page.

In the following documentation, some strings have been shortened or wrapped:
"`[...]`" indicates extra data was removed, and lines ending in a single backslash "\\" are continued below.

### Specification Disclaimer

This documentation serves to educate users and developers about how Dimecoin works, but it is not intended as a specification. Dimecoin’s security hinges on consensus; deviations, regardless of their origin—be it a program bug, an error in this documentation, or anomalies in network software—can compromise or entirely undermine that security. The accurate measure of consensus behavior is the real-time operation of the network maintaining consensus. Given the network’s diverse inputs and environments, fully capturing every aspect of their behavior in any documentation is impossible.

In addition, we also warn you that this documentation is continually evolving and is often not heavily reviewed, so it likely contains numerous errors.
